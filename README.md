Watch Twitch VODs together with Chat!

## Purpose
Twitch VODs that are saved on the website get deleted either after a certain amount of time or if the streamer chooses to remove it, and while there are many tools out there right now that can download VODs and their chat logs, you still can't play the VOD **while** having the chat displayed at the same time **in sync** with the current time of the video.

This application allows you to do just that! With this, you can permanently store and watch VODs anytime along with their chat and you won't have to worry about it getting deleted on the website.

## Requirements
 - .NET Framework 4.7.1 or higher

## Download
 [Twitch VOD Player can be downloaded here](https://github.com/Alycse/TwitchVodWithChatPlayer/releases)
 
## Features
 - Chat Box can be freely moved and resized.
 - Can display Twitch Emotes!
 - Can display Channel Badges!
 - Can display BTTV Emotes and FFZ Emotes!
 - Transparent Chat Box background can be enabled/disabled.
 - Can adjust the offset of the chat with the video.
 - Functions similarly to your usual video player application.
 - Can resume to the last position of previously played videos.
 - You can drag video files onto the player to open and play them.
 - Can download the chat log of a VOD. (This uses [RechatTool by jdpurcell!](https://github.com/jdpurcell/RechatTool))
 - Can check for new updates.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to jdpurcell's [RechatTool](https://github.com/jdpurcell/RechatTool), you don't need a separate tool to get a VOD's chat log from Twitch!

## Issues
If you encounter any issues with the application, [please let me know](https://github.com/Alycse/TwitchVodWithChatPlayer/issues) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

This is my very first full and complete program that I've publicly released *ever* outside of video games (in which I used engines for), and this is also my first time using GitHub so I'm still kind of getting used to it. I mainly developed this program for educational purposes and for my own use *because I'm a huge vodfriend :)* **but** I'm still going to update it and keep it alive as much as I can, especially if there's a bug or if any of the APIs break.
